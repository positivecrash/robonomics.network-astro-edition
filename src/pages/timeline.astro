Robonomics 1.0 on Substrate has been released, and we have been testing connecting sensors to the parachain to send their telemetry data, as well as developing the digital twin functionality. In the middle of the year, we decided to test the full cycle of our network and created our own relay chain called <a class='timeline__link' href='/blog/robonomics-frontier/' target='_blank' aria-label="found out more about robonomics frontier">Robonomics Frontier</a>, to which the Robonomics parachain was integrated (prior to being migrated to the Kusama relay chain).

    title: 'Transition to Multinetwork — Along Came Polkadot',
    text: `<p class='timeline__descr'> There came a time when the existing limitations of Ethereum <a class='timeline__link' href='https://blog.aira.life/on-top-of-two-world-computers-research-questions-a83570f4c8b1' target='_blank' aria-label-"check out our blog to learn more">began to stand out clearly</a> (in particular, poor scalability, low speed and very high cost of transactions). The upgrade to ETH2.0 was supposed to fix the situation, but this upgrade was repeatedly delayed. Whilst we did not want to leave the Ethereum network, we realized that in the current situation it was difficult to implement our use cases, and we began to look for an alternative network. The sharded blockchain ecosystem Polkadot became this alternative. We started by experimenting with the Substrate framework to migrate the main Robonomics features and to deploy our own testnet. By the end of this stage, we had deployed our parachain on the Rococo testnet and started preparing to get a slot on the Kusama network. </p><p class='timeline__descr'> Continuing to study IoT systems, we have identified the main functionality of Robonomics, which can add value to users — the function of decentralized cloud for IoT. This idea formed the basis of <a class='timeline__link' href='https://blog.aira.life/robonomics-web-services-and-rws-token-intro-d730ab50ad42' target='_blank' aria-label="learn more about robonomics web sevices">Robonomics Web Services</a>. The RWS infrastructure took on all the functions of a typical centralized cloud, but without the standard problems of global availability, security and privacy. Additionally, we came up with the idea of parachain IoT subscriptions that allows subscription holders to use the blockchain network without having to pay a fee for each transaction. The first experiment with IoT subscriptions was the emission of the RWS token, which allows its owner to send 1 transaction per block. In addition, we began to take the first steps to develop our own hardware kit for control of smart devices (the DAOS concept). </p><p class='timeline__descr'> Of course, support for Robonomics on Ethereum has not stopped. The Robonomics communication stack has been finalized to version <a class='timeline__link' href='https://github.com/airalab/robonomics_comm/releases/tag/v1.0.0' target='_blank' aria-lable="check out lts.1.0 version"> LTS 1.0.</a>. The XRT token has started trading on several exchanges (in particular, the Uniswap DEX), and the liquidity incentivization program was launched.</p><p class='timeline__descr'> The team actively developed ways to interact with the community. The first version of our <a class='timeline__link' href='https://blog.aira.life/the-robonomics-dapp-overview-acb003f51b9a' target='_blank' aria-label="learn more about our dapp">dapp</a> site and Robonomics Wiki have been launched.
